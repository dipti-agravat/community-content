## Article
If you read this, you are interested by writing articles for strapi and that's great!
However there is some point that we want to clarify before you get into this experience.

Indeed we want to make sure that strapi articles are:

  - **Comprehensive by anyone, even your grandmother**
Our articles are written in such a way that a beginner as well as an expert can understand and reproduce the content of the tutorial very easily. A user facing a complicated tutorial will not last long and will be discouraged. Make it extremely easy to understand and follow!
  - **Explain everything**
All commands must be well explained so the user does not feel lost. Do not hesitate to say why you choose a specific technology, package, or service.
  - **Useful and practical**
We want to offer quality tutorials that prove to be really useful and interesting for others like connecting strapi with a frontend framework: "How to create a Trip Advisor project like with Nuxt.js and strapi"


### Structure

  - Title
  - Introduction, (what people will learn in this article)
  - Goals, (what people will be able to achieve)
  - Prerequisites, (what people need to achieve the tutorial)
    - Specify the version of Strapi (alpha, beta)  
  - Step 1 - First thing to do
  - Step 2 - Second thing...
  - Step n - Last thing to do
  - Include code source (github)
  - Conclusion

#### Title

We recommend using this format: **How to <accomplish a task> with <technologies>**
The title is very important, indeed, it must allow the user to know exactly what he will be able to do/find in this article. The user will be more interested by the goal of the article than the technologies used, think about it!

#### Introduction
The introduction is a key point of the tutorial. Indeed it allows to formally explain what will be:
  - **The goal of the tutorial or topic**
  - **What softwares are involved and why**
  - **Why the reader should follow this tutorial or topic**

#### Goal
This part does nothing more than explain the purpose of this article and what the reader will be able to accomplish at the end of it. Make the reader want to accomplish such a goal!

#### Prerequesites
If you are writing a tutorial, it is very important to list the prerequisites. The reader must be aware of what he needs to start the tutorial correctly.

#### Steps
This part defines the different steps of your tutorial and indicates precisely what the reader must do.

There must be an introduction for each step and a transition before the next one
All commands must be explained and must reside in their own code block. It is important to specify the path in which they are executed so that the reader is not lost.
  
It is also strongly advisable to add screenshots. 

It is obvious to detail each script / code that you include so that the reader can really understand its usefulness and subsequently customize it. As well as the link to the source code (Github)

#### Conclusion
The conclusion must summarize what the reader has just accomplished but also propose what he could do afterwards. Indeed proposing improvements, adjustments is a very good point. 

#### Do not forget to:
  - Add the word count at the end of your article - excluding the code.
  - Use Grammarly https://app.grammarly.com/ to fix all spelling and grammar mistakes.
  - Create two images for your article - [Access the template](https://www.figma.com/file/gI8PcsqInk3DAwfIxmcyPI/For-Authors) Duplicate the template and create two images for your article.

### SEO Guidelines
  
  ## Title
Include (1-2) keywords in the title.
No more than 60 characters.

  ## Meta Description
Add a meta description for your article. Place essential keywords (2-3) in the first two sentences of the description.
No more than 155 characters. [Here are few examples](https://themeisle.com/blog/meta-description-examples/) 

  ## Content
  - Introduction: The introduction needs to quickly hook your reader and convince them to read the rest of your blog post. It also has to let the reader know what your post is about. Whether your approach is humour, interesting and surprising facts, or asking a question, find a way to make the first lines of your blog posts as attention-grabbing as possible. Write an introduction that would make you want to keep reading an article -- a quick few paragraphs to draw the reader in and let him know what he's about to read.
  - Paragraphs: Please use sub-headers to split up sections of your blog post (H2 tag). Optimize them by using keywords.
  - Linking: Please link to at least [one blog post published on our Blog](https://strapi.io/blog) Make sure to also link to high ranking external websites and add a rell=nofollow. Self-promotion or Affiliate links within post content are not allowed as well. Please use as much [contextual links](https://www.eebew.com/seo-tutorial/on-page-seo/basic-elements/internal-navigation/contextual-link-building/) as possible.
  - When adding links, please include the link on a keyword. Don't use "click here" nor "there" nor "link". Example: If the blog articles refer to keywords related to front technology such as "next.js", "gatsby" in the blog article, we should link these words to our integration pages. That creates internal linking and more "seo weight" to our integrations pages. —> This principle applies to all the words that can be linked to a Strapi page.
  - The longer your article is, the better Google will reference it.
  - Please compress your images before uploading them.
  - Please, be sure to not write hard sentences. You can use this great tool for that https://hemingwayapp.com.

  ## Images
  - Please use [this figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/gI8PcsqInk3DAwfIxmcyPI/For-Authors?node-id=0%3A1) to create your article images. Please duplicate the template before creating your article images.
  - You need to create 2 images for your blog post. 
      - Image 1: 
          - CATEGORY: choose the category that best represent your article. Option 1; “TUTORIALS”, If its not a tutorial, please use the category: “ECOSYSTEM”
          - TITLE: Add the title - make sure it is SEO friendly
          - ICONS: Select the best format for your article. You can use white or colored icons.  and icons of the technology used in your article. You can use an emoji if no specific technology is mentioned in your article.
      - Image 2:
          - TITLE; Add the same title that was used in your first image.
          - NAME: Add your first & last name
          - Image: Add a photo of you.
  - Once you duplicate and implement the edits, please click on export and add your pictures in your dropbox link.  Please do not delete your templates. We might need it to implement some changes to your pictures.
